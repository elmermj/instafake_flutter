# instafake_flutter

A new Flutter project.

## WARNING
This application has only been tested on the Android 11 platform (Galaxy A50 and S10). There are several changes regarding permissions on Android 13 and above which I'm afraid I overlooked as I haven't tested it yet on my newest Android devices. I haven't tested it on iOS as I don't have MacOS for compiling the app.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
